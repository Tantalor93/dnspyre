# Rate limiting
*dnspyre* supports rate limiting number of queries send per second, for that you can use `--rate-limit` and `--rate-limit-worker` flags

`--rate-limit` is used for setting a global rate limit, meaning that all concurrent workers spawned based on `--concurrency` flag will share this limit.
It might happen, that some workers will be starving and the load generated by the `dnspyre` will not be evenly generated from all workers.

For example this will generate load for 10 seconds using 10 concurrent workers and limit the load to 1 query per second

```
dnspyre --duration 10s -c 10 --rate-limit 1 --server '8.8.8.8' google.com
```

\
`--rate-limit-worker` is used for setting a rate limit **separately** for each concurrent worker spawned based on `--concurrency` flag.

For example this will generate load for 10 seconds using 10 concurrent workers and limit the load generated by each worker to 1 query per second

```
dnspyre --duration 10s -c 10 --rate-limit-worker 1 --server '8.8.8.8' google.com
```
