# dnspyre

*dnspyre* is a command-line DNS benchmark tool built to stress test and measure the performance of DNS servers. You can easily run benchmark from MacOS, Linux or Windows systems.
This tool is based and originally forked from [dnstrace](https://github.com/redsift/dnstrace), but was largely rewritten and enhanced with additional functionality.

This tool supports wide variety of options to customize DNS benchmark and benchmark output. For example, you can:
* benchmark DNS servers using DNS queries over UDP or TCP, see [plain DNS example](plaindns.md)
* benchmark DNS servers with all kinds of query types like A, AAAA, CNAME, HTTPS, ... (`--type` option)
* benchmark DNS servers with a lot of parallel queries and connections (`--number`, `--concurrency` options)
* benchmark DNS servers for a specified duration (`--duration` option)
* benchmark DNS servers with DoT ([DNS over TLS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7858)), see [DoT example](dot.md)
* benchmark DNS servers using DoH ([DNS over HTTPS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8484)), see [DoH example](doh.md)
* benchmark DNS servers using DoQ ([DNS over QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9250/)), see [DoQ example](doq.md)
* benchmark DNS servers with uneven random load from provided high volume resources (see `--probability` option)
* plot benchmark results via CLI histogram or plot the benchmark results as boxplot, histogram, line graphs and export them via all kind of image formats like png, svg and pdf. (see `--plot` and `--plotf` options)

## Usage

```
usage: dnspyre [<flags>] <queries>...

A high QPS DNS benchmark.


Flags:
      --[no-]help              Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).
  -s, --server="127.0.0.1"     Server represents (plain DNS, DoT, DoH or DoQ) server, which will be benchmarked. Format depends on the
                               DNS protocol, that should be used for DNS benchmark. For plain DNS (either over UDP or TCP) the format is
                               <IP/host>[:port], if port is not provided then port 53 is used. For DoT the format is <IP/host>[:port],
                               if port is not provided then port 853 is used. For DoH the format is https://<IP/host>[:port][/path] or
                               http://<IP/host>[:port][/path], if port is not provided then either 443 or 80 port is used. If no path is
                               provided, then /dns-query is used. For DoQ the format is quic://<IP/host>[:port], if port is not provided
                               then port 853 is used.
  -t, --type=A ...             Query type. Repeatable flag. If multiple query types are specified then each query will be duplicated for
                               each type.
  -n, --number=NUMBER          How many times the provided queries are repeated. Note that the total number of queries issued =
                               types*number*concurrency*len(queries).
  -c, --concurrency=1          Number of concurrent queries to issue.
  -l, --rate-limit=0           Apply a global questions / second rate limit.
      --rate-limit-worker=0    Apply a questions / second rate limit for each concurrent worker specified by --concurrency option.
      --query-per-conn=0       Queries on a connection before creating a new one. 0: unlimited. Applicable for plain DNS and DoT,
                               this option is not considered for DoH or DoQ.
  -r, --[no-]recurse           Allow DNS recursion. Enabled by default.
      --probability=1          Each provided hostname will be used with provided probability. Value 1 and above means that each hostname
                               will be used by each concurrent benchmark goroutine. Useful for randomizing queries across benchmark
                               goroutines.
      --ednsopt=""             code[:value], Specify EDNS option with code point code and optionally payload of value as a hexadecimal
                               string. code must be an arbitrary numeric value.
      --[no-]dnssec            Allow DNSSEC (sets DO bit for all DNS requests to 1)
      --edns0=0                Configures EDNS0 usage in DNS requests send by benchmark and configures EDNS0 buffer size to the
                               specified value. When 0 is configured, then EDNS0 is not used.
      --[no-]tcp               Use TCP for DNS requests.
      --[no-]dot               Use DoT (DNS over TLS) for DNS requests.
      --write=1s               write timeout.
      --read=3s                read timeout.
      --connect=1s             connect timeout.
      --request=5s             request timeout.
      --[no-]codes             Enable counting DNS return codes. Enabled by default.
      --min=400Âµs              Minimum value for timing histogram.
      --max=MAX                Maximum value for timing histogram.
      --precision=[1-5]        Significant figure for histogram precision.
      --[no-]distribution      Display distribution histogram of timings to stdout. Enabled by default.
      --csv=/path/to/file.csv  Export distribution to CSV.
      --[no-]json              Report benchmark results as JSON.
      --[no-]silent            Disable stdout.
      --[no-]color             ANSI Color output. Enabled by default.
      --plot=/path/to/folder   Plot benchmark results and export them to the directory.
      --plotf=svg              Format of graphs. Supported formats: svg, png and jpg.
      --doh-method=post        HTTP method to use for DoH requests. Supported values: get, post.
      --doh-protocol=1.1       HTTP protocol to use for DoH requests. Supported values: 1.1, 2 and 3.
      --[no-]insecure          Disables server TLS certificate validation. Applicable for DoT, DoH and DoQ.
  -d, --duration=1m            Specifies for how long the benchmark should be executing, the benchmark will run for the specified time
                               while sending DNS requests in an infinite loop based on the data source. After running for the specified
                               duration, the benchmark is canceled. This option is exclusive with --number option. The duration is
                               specified in GO duration format e.g. 10s, 15m, 1h.
      --[no-]progress          Controls whether the progress bar is shown. Enabled by default.
      --[no-]version           Show application version.

Args:
  <queries>  Queries to issue. It can be a local file referenced using @<file-path>, for example @data/2-domains. It can also be
             resource accessible using HTTP, like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tantalor93/dnspyre/master/data/1000-domains,
             in that case, the file will be downloaded and saved in-memory. These data sources can be combined, for example "google.com
             @data/2-domains https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tantalor93/dnspyre/master/data/2-domains"
